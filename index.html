              <h3 class="mb-0">Anagram Solver</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">iOS and Android Application</div>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">What does it do?</div>
              <p>The Anagram Solver app is a simple application, built natively for both Android and iOS, designed to assist with solving anagrams and crossword puzzles. The app can full anagrams where all letters are known but the order is not, it can find potential solutions to anagrams where some of the letters are kown but the order is not and can also help solve crossword puzzles where some of the letters are known and the position of each letter within the word is also know, beyond that, this app can also be used to find sub-anagrams, words of lesser length that can be made with some of the original letters.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">Why was it built?</div>
              <p>The intention behind this application was to built a simple app, where the focus was mainly set upon the publishing and review process of each of the major app store, the complexity of the app was less important here as this was an excersise in learning to publish an application and what was involved with that.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">How does it work?</div>
              <p>This app takes the anagram the user has entered and begins to loop through all words in the dictionary, frstly eliminating all words whose length does not match that of the anagram.</p>
              <p>Once a word of the right length has been found, the algorithm loops through that word checking if the count of letter within the anagram is equal to the count of each letter within the current dictionary word. As soon as a letter count is found to be different between the anagram and dictionary word, the loop breaks as the dictionary word cannot possibly be a potential solution.</p>
              <p>If the letter counts of each letter in the word match those in the anagram, then the word must be a potential solution and is appended to the array of results and presented to the user once the dictionary has been looped all the way through.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Track Tel</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">iOS and Android Application</div>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">What does it do?</div>
              <p>TrackTel is an app designed for use on trackdays, hillclimbs and sprint courses, used to record the lap times of a users track day to mointor improvement throughout a day or between changes made to a car. This application began development as my final year project at university and since then has had a re-designed UI and significant changes to the way in which laps are timed. It uses GPS to track the location of the user and geofencing determine whether or not the start/finish line of the chosen track has been crossed and take lap times and the average and VMax speed of the user.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">Why was it built?</div>
              <p>TrackTel began development as my final year project for university where I built the first version of this project as an Android application. Upon graduation, I decided that I could build a better version of this app and carried on developing it with a better timinging algoriuthm based on more accurate location tracking along with a database of UK race racks for the user to choose from. This was when i began developing it as an iOS application.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">How does it work?</div>
              <p>The app has a database containing all major UK racetracks, along with basic information about them such as the name, location, number of layouts and the length, number of turns and timing information for each layout.</p>
              <p>Timing is achieved by checking whether a line drawn between the current and last location of the user intersects with a line drawn between two points either side of the start/finish line. A geofence is also set up on the start finish line so that the app only checks if these two lines intersect within 100m of the start/finish line and not all the way round the track as there is no need to check if the finish line is apssed when the user is on the otherside of the track, making the app more efficient.</p>
              <p>CoreData is used to store any data saved from the user's trackday so that it can then be accessed and views at a later date.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">The Littlest Gear</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">iOS Application</div>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">What does it do?</div>
              <p>The intention behind The Littlest Gear was to bring industry with old fashioned practices right up to date. In the car restoration business, work often takes far longer than anticipated and cars can spend months or year at garages with little or no progress and poor comunication from garages.</p>
              <p> The Littlest Gear gives the owner of the car a way to track the progress of their restoration right through from start to finish, allowing the work to be done to be agreed before hand, and as each job is completed, it will show as done in the app along with notes about the job and any issues they encountered along with pictures of the work and a breakdown of cost split up between materials and labour.</p>
              <p>It also hands back some control to user over the restoration of their car regarding the work that can be done, as well as both owner and garage being able to add work to be done retrospectively, any new work added by the garage will have to be approved by the owner, and the job will be locked until this has happened putting a stop to unexpected bills for the owner at the end of a restoration.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">Why was it built?</div>
              <p>The Littlest Gear was inspired by watching Richard hammond's Workshop and sesing how some of the problems encountered such as not billing for hours correctly and customers having to wait far longer than expected for projects to be completed, could have been solved.</p>
              <p>This app then became an oppotunity to learn how to implement Firebase into a mobile application and make use of features such as Authentication, Databases and Cloud Firestore as these would be essential in producing an application that could be used by users with different levels of authorisation and be able to share data on one app between eachother.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3"> Demo</div>
              <p>Below is a video demonstrating the features currently implemented within The Littlest Gear.</p>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">iOS Application</div>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">What does it do?</div>
              <p>This is a very simple app which allows users to genrate AI images from any given prompt and served as an introduction to using AI within a mobile application, in this case the SwiftOpenAI API which can be found <a href="https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI" class="text">here</a></p>
              <p>Currently implemented features include generating AI images from prompts and creating variations of a generated image, however, the ability to edit an image has not yet been implemented.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">Why was it built?</div>
              <p>Recently, the number of AI tools available consumers has increased massively all with a myriad of use cases, this app was an introduction into using an AI API within a mobile application and how it works within a relatively simple application, laying the foundation for more complex use cases in the future.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">How does it work?</div>
              <p>The user enters a prompt into a text box at the top of the screen and taps the "Generate Image" button, the app then requests an image from the OpenAIService using the user's prompt and the desired format (dalle2), displaying a ProgressView whilst waiting for a response from OpenAI. Upon receiving a response, the image is displayed assuming no errors are encountered, in which case the error message would be displayed instead.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">Road Rally Navigation</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">iOS Application</div>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">What does it do?</div>
              <p>Road Rally Navgation was built off the back of Track Tel but rather than being used for lap timing on circuits, this app is used to time point to point road rallies.</p>
              <p>The user is presented with a list of stages that are included in the rally along with the target speed and time for that stage.</p>
              <p>Upon choosing a stage to complete, the user is shown a map indicating the start and finish of that stage, they also have the ability to show the route from their location to the start of the stage, allowing them to find their way to the beginning of the timed stage.</p>
              <p>A sheet can be presented which shows the user's current time and everage speed, dependant on wheher they have entered the timed stage, along with the times and average speeds of any stage they have already completed.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">Why was it built?</div>
              <p>This app was built to be an introduction to Apple's MapKit, as the timing capabilities of the app are pulled from TrackTel, it was an ideal way to begin learning to use MapKit withouting having to develop a whole applicartion from scratch but rather adapt code that I already had.</p>
              <p>This project has given me a foundational knowledge of using MapKit and its various features such as markers, directions, user-location and map controls.</p>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">How does it work?</div>
              <p>This app uses a geofencing to determine whether or not the user has neared the start line of the timed stage, once the geofence has been entered, the app will then begin to check whether or not the user has crossed the start line, this is done by drawing a line between the user's current location and thir last location, and checking if this line has intersected with the start line.</p>
              <p>Once the line has been crossed, the timer begins and the users speed is tracked to give live information to the user, along with calculating average speed to determine whether the user has completed the stage in time. During the stage, the app is also using the same algorithm to determine whether the finish line has been crossed, when this happens, the timer is stopped.</p>
              <p>The stage will then show as completed and the user can move onto the next stage.</p>
